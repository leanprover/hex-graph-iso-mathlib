Mathlib-facing coloured graphs.

`SimpleGraph.Coloring` expresses proper colouring, where adjacent
vertices must have different colours; that is not nauty's input. The
object here is an arbitrary ordered vertex partition: a `SimpleGraph`
together with an onto colour map into `Fin k`. An isomorphism preserves
each ordered colour index and may not permute the cells.

The structure requires every colour to occur. A caller with a
non-surjective map can either restrict `k` and renumber the used colours
explicitly, or use the checked helper `Colored.ofColor?`, which returns
`none` together with nothing rather than silently compressing or
reordering colours — compression would change the canonical labelling
convention.
