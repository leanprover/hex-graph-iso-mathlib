Mathlib-facing coloured graphs.

`SimpleGraph.Coloring` expresses proper colouring, where adjacent
vertices must have different colours. That is not nauty's input. The
object here is an arbitrary ordered vertex partition: a `SimpleGraph`
together with an onto colour map into `Fin k`. An isomorphism preserves
each ordered colour index and may not permute the cells.

The structure requires every colour to occur. A caller whose colour map
is not onto can restrict `k` and renumber the used colours explicitly,
or call `Colored.ofColor?`, which returns `none` instead of compressing
or reordering the colours. Compressing them would change the ordered
colouring, and with it the canonical labelling.

/-- A finite simple graph with an ordered vertex colouring by `Fin k` in
which every colour is used. This is the Mathlib-side counterpart of
`Hex.GraphIso.Colored`: the colouring need not be proper, and an
isomorphism has to preserve each colour index. -/
